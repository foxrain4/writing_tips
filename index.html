  <h2 style="color: #f76707;">Share Your Knowledge About Writing</h2>
  <p>
    Everyone has a story to tell. Whether you're a lifelong writer or someone who jots down ideas between coffee breaks, 
    your experience matters. This page is an open space to explore writing—how we do it, why we do it, and what we’ve learned along the way.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #51cf66;">Why Share Your Experience?</h3>
  <p>
    Writing isn't just about technique—it's about perspective. Your struggles, breakthroughs, and odd little rituals can spark 
    creativity in someone else. From planning to editing to storytelling itself, the way you write could help others find their voice.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #339af0;">Practical Writing Tips</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
    <li>✏️ Keep a writing notebook—even if it's messy</li>
    <li>⏱️ Don’t wait for inspiration. Try timed writing sprints</li>
    <li>🔄 Write badly on purpose in your first draft—then edit</li>
    <li>🧃 Take breaks and come back with fresh eyes</li>
    <li>🧪 Try different mediums: poetry, journals, short scenes</li>
    <li>🧠 Observe how others write—then break their rules</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color: #ae3ec9;">What You Can Share</h3>
  <p>
    Whether you're writing short stories, text-based adventures, or worldbuilding logs, your methods and mindset are worth sharing.
    What inspires you? How do you deal with writer’s block? What makes your characters real to you?
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #fcc419;">Writing Tips Made Simple</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
    <li>🗡️ Use clean, clear verbs: “spurred” is better than “heaved his horse”</li>
    <li>🔤 Use commas for flow: “He rode, and the battle raged on.”</li>
    <li>🪶 Choose the right words: “true” vs “real” sets different tones</li>
    <li>📍 Prepositions matter: “from” shows origin, “for” shows purpose</li>
    <li>📛 Capitalize titles like “The Ancient One”; use quotes for “The Eternal One”</li>
    <li>👥 “You are” works for one or many — just remember the plural rule</li>
    <li>✅ Every sentence needs a subject and verb: a full thought</li>
    <li>📖 Names set the tone: “The Dark Sovereign” vs “The Timeless One”</li>
    <li>🔥 Strong verbs > weak ones: say “charged” instead of “went”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color: #ff8787;">Quick Writing Boosts</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
    <li>🎭 Show, don’t tell: “He slammed the door” beats “He was angry”</li>
    <li>✂️ Cut filler words: remove “just,” “very,” and “really”</li>
    <li>📌 Use vivid nouns: “ruins” is stronger than “old place”</li>
    <li>⛓️ Break long sentences for better rhythm</li>
    <li>🗣️ Let dialogue reveal emotion and motive</li>
    <li>🌑 Set tone fast: dark, light, dramatic, or weird</li>
    <li>🎼 Vary sentence length to keep the reader engaged</li>
    <li>🏃‍♂️ Limit adverbs: use strong verbs instead</li>
    <li>🎯 End with power — your last line should echo</li>
    <li>🧩 Think in beats — one idea per sentence or paragraph</li>
  </ul>
